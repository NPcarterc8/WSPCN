>    My name is Corey Carter, and I am a Computer Science major with goals to get a Ph.D. in the same field, studying AI (Artificial Intelligence) and/or Cybersecurity. I started learning the field of computer science during a Google coding internship program named Google Code Next. From there, the rest is history, as I have learned many different coding languages such as Java, Python, and more. Some of the projects I have worked on include different websites and robots. For example, I am currently working on a project that combines a scheduler algorithm with an LMS (Learning Management System). I have also collaborated with others on coding projects; however, these projects were for classroom assignments. The computer science classes I have taken so far are Computer Science 1, 2, and 3, Assembly language, and Digital Logic. This semester, I'm taking your class, Language Processing, and Operating Systems.
    
>    By taking this course, I see myself improving my coding skills and learning new skills. For example, I have learned SQL; however, MongoDB is the new up-and-coming database management system, so in all, this class is helping me understand that new skill. So, with that, I'm going to take what I learn from this class and apply it to either current projects that I have in mind or future projects or jobs.
